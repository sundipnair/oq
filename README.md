[![oq](https://snapcraft.io/oq/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/oq)

A performant, portable [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/) wrapper thats facilitates the consumption and output of formats other than JSON; using `jq` filters to transform the data.

* Compiles to a single binary for easy portability.
* Performant, similar performance with JSON data compared to `jq`.  Slightly longer execution time when going to/from a non-JSON format.  
* Supports XML and YAML as additional input/output formats.

## Installation

### Linux via [snap](https://snapcraft.io/)

For more on installing & using `snap` with your Linux distribution, see the [official documentation](https://docs.snapcraft.io/installing-snapd).

```bash
snap install oq
```

### MacOS

```bash
brew tap blacksmoke16/tap
brew install oq
```

### From Source

If building from source, `jq` will need to be installed separately. Installation instructions can be found in the [official documentation](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

Requires Crystal to be installed, see the [installation documentation](https://crystal-lang.org/install).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/oq.git
cd oq/
shards build --production
```

The built binary will be available as `./bin/oq`.  This can be relocated elsewhere on your machine; be sure it is in your `PATH` to access it as `oq`.

### Docker container

To install oq into a container use the following Dockerfile,

```Dockerfile
FROM crystallang/crystal:latest

RUN apt update && apt install -y jq

COPY ./binaries/oq /bin/oq
RUN chmod +x /bin/oq
RUN /bin/oq --help
```

Prerequisites:
1. Download the oq binary using this link https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/oq/releases/tag/v0.2.1
2. Rename rename the binary from oq-0.2.1-linux-x86_64 to oq
3. Create a binaries folder in the same folder as the Dockerfile and move the oq binary into it 

## Usage

### CLI

Use the `oq` binary, with a few optional custom arguments, see `oq --help`.  All other arguments get passed to `jq`. See [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) for details.

### Examples

#### Consume JSON and output XML

```bash
echo '{"name": "Jim"}' | oq -o xml .
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
  <name>Jim</name>
</root>
```

#### Consume YAML from a file and output JSON

data.yaml

```yaml
---
name: Jim
numbers:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
```

```bash
oq -i yaml -o xml . data.yaml 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
  <name>Jim</name>
  <numbers>1</numbers>
  <numbers>2</numbers>
  <numbers>3</numbers>
</root>
```

## Roadmap

Plans for `1.0.0`:

* XML input format
* Address bugs/issues that arise
* Small feature requests
* Possibly additional formats
